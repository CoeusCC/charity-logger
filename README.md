==============

This project will be a server database with web CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) to catalog privately and publicly funded resources for those in need.

Based on the preferences of the organization's founder, this project will (at the start) utilize [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com) to develop a model to be used in any part of the US, but the initial focus is Bryan/College Station, TX, since that is the home base of the organization.
